# Predicting_House_Sale_Prices

In this project, we explored how the linear regression model worked, understood the approach to model fitting, and some techniques for cleaning, transforming, and selecting features. Moreover, we explored ways to improve the model we built. However, we worked with housing data for the city of Ames, Iowa, United States from 2006 to 2010. You can read more about why the data was collected [here](https://doi.org/10.1080/10691898.2011.11889627).
